# jjjj

You probably don't care about the code in this repo. Most of jjjj's code is in https://github.com/rweichler/jjjj

Anyway, this is all the C/objc stuff.

If to build this, just compile all of the files in src/objc/ somehow, then stick that in your /Applications/jjjj.app directory.

You can also try using aite, which is my build system.

Just run these commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/rweichler/jjjj-core
git clone https://github.com/rweichler/aite
cd jjjj-core
../aite/main.lua
```

And it should make jjjj.deb.
